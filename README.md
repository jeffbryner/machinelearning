machinelearning
===============

Experiments in machine learning for web logs presented at bsides Vancouver 2014. 

The python notebooks can be run via::

  ipython notebook

in the directory where you place the notebooks. 

The mlTail.py program is meant to take incoming logs via stdin and produce a report of 
bad actors after stdin has stopped. 

These tools all use the excellent topic modelling library: gensim available via::

  pip install gensim
